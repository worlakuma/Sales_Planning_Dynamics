# Sales_Planning_Dynamics
Tracks and adjusts production based on sales and stock levels, ensuring optimal inventory management through automated calculations. Essential for maintaining efficient supply chains.

Manage production and stock efficiently with our automated system that adjusts production quantities based on monthly sales and stock balances.
## Features- **Automated Production Adjustments**: Calculates necessary production adjustments to meet sales demands.- **Real-time Stock Management**: Updates stock levels in real time following sales activity.
## How It Works
The script processes monthly sales data and compares it with existing stock. If sales exceed stock, production is ramped up accordingly. If sales are less than the stock, the stock is adjusted without additional production.
### System Outputs- Production quantities for each month.- Updated stock levels post-sale.

## Usage
Simply input your monthly sales data and current stock levels to receive updated production and stock information.
## Example Output```plaintext
Production Quantity For Month 2 := 0 New Stock Level 2 := 950
Production Quantity For Month 3 := 120 New Stock Level 3 := 1000
